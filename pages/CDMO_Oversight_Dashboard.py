    As the MSAT lead, I am accountable for the technical oversight of all manufacturing activities at our Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs). This dashboard is my central tool for data-driven management of these critical partnerships, in line with ICH Q10 guidelines.

    - **Performance Monitoring:** I use this data to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for each CDMO, which serves as the basis for technical discussions during Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs).
    - **Quality & Compliance:** Tracking batch success rates and deviation trends provides a real-time view of a CDMO's quality culture and their ability to operate our process in a state of control.
    - **Supply Chain Assurance:** Proactively monitoring the inventory of critical, long-lead-time raw materials at our CDMOs is essential for preventing production delays and ensuring continuity of supply.
    - **Risk Management:** The data presented here serves as a direct input into our Quality Risk Management program, helping us to identify and mitigate risks associated with our external manufacturing network.

    These trends provide a high-level view of the operational health of each partner.
    - **CDMO Gamma Performance:** This site is a clear concern. Their batch success rate dropped significantly in Q1 and Q2 2024, corresponding with a sustained high number of deviations. This indicates a potential systemic issue with their quality systems or operational discipline. **Action:** As the MSAT lead, I would schedule a deep-dive technical meeting with CDMO Gamma to review every deviation from the last quarter and co-develop a robust CAPA plan.
    - **CDMO Alpha Improvement:** This site experienced a critical deviation in Q1 but has since maintained a 100% success rate with a declining deviation trend in Q2. This suggests that their corrective actions were effective. **Action:** I will follow up during our next QBR to confirm the sustainability of this improvement.

    - **Immediate Risk:** The **Viral Filter** at **CDMO Gamma** is below safety stock. This is a critical, long-lead-time item. A production delay is imminent if a new order is not expedited. **Action:** I will immediately contact our supply chain group and the CDMO to understand the status of the next delivery and assess the immediate risk to the upcoming campaign.
    - **Proactive Action:** The **IEX-2 Resin** at **CDMO Beta** has hit its re-order point. **Action:** I will confirm with our supply chain counterparts that a new purchase order has been placed to prevent a future stockout.

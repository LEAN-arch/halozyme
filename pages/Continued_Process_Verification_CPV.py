    The goal of Continued Process Verification (CPV) is to continually assure that the process remains in a state of control during routine commercial manufacturing. As the MSAT lead, this is a cornerstone of my lifecycle management responsibilities.

    - **FDA Process Validation Guidance (Stage 3):** This guidance explicitly calls for an ongoing program to collect and analyze product and process data that relate to product quality. This dashboard is our primary tool for fulfilling this requirement.
    - **ICH Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development):** CPV is a key component of lifecycle management, ensuring that the process remains within the established **Design Space**.
    - **Purpose:** This dashboard is used to:
        1.  Monitor Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) using statistical control charts.
        2.  Detect and investigate any unexpected process variability or trends.
        3.  Periodically assess the Process Capability (Ppk) to ensure we can consistently meet our quality specifications.
        4.  Provide data for Annual Product Quality Reviews (APQRs) and regulatory inspections.

    ### Overall MSAT Conclusion & Action Plan
    
    This holistic CPV analysis tells a clear, data-driven story:
    
    1.  **The Problem:** Our CQA, **Purity**, is in a state of drift, and its process capability is unacceptable (Ppk < 1.0).
    2.  **The Clues:** The control charts for the CPPs show that **Load Density** and **Conductivity** are stable (with one historical special cause). However, the CMA, **Resin Age**, shows a clear, expected upward trend as the column is used.
    3.  **The Smoking Gun:** The **Correlation Matrix** provides the critical link. It shows a very strong **negative correlation (r = -0.96)** between **CMA - Resin Age** and **CQA - Purity**. This is our primary hypothesis. There is also a weaker, secondary negative correlation with Conductivity.
    
    **Action Plan as MSAT Lead:**
    - **Immediate Investigation:** The data strongly suggests that the declining purity is due to the chromatography resin nearing the end of its validated lifetime. The resin's ability to clear impurities is degrading with each cycle.
    - **Corrective Action:** I will issue a formal recommendation to the CDMO to strip, clean, and re-pack the column with new resin before the next set of batches.
    - **Preventive Action (Lifecycle Management):** This analysis provides the data to justify tightening the validated lifetime of the IEX resin. I will initiate a change control to reduce the maximum number of cycles from (for example) 250 to 200 to ensure this downward trend does not impact future batches. This is a perfect example of using CPV data to drive continuous improvement and ensure long-term process robustness.

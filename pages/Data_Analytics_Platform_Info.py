- **Statistical Process Control (SPC):**
  - I-MR, Xbar-R, and Xbar-S control charts for monitoring CPPs and CQAs.
  - Implementation of Western Electric (WECO) or Nelson rules for trend analysis.

- **Process Capability Analysis:**
  - Calculation of Cp, Cpk, Pp, and Ppk for normal and non-normal data.
  - Generation of process capability histograms.

- **Statistical Modeling & Comparison:**
  - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and t-tests for lot-to-lot comparisons and process change assessments.
  - Design of Experiments (DOE) analysis, including Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for process optimization and characterization.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Box plots, scatter plots, time-series plots, and Pareto charts.

    As the MSAT authority for Halozyme's downstream drug substance manufacturing, this Command Center is my primary tool for ensuring the consistency, robustness, and compliance of our externally manufactured products. It provides a single source of truth for data-driven oversight and decision-making, in line with our "One Team" culture of collaboration.

    #### **How This Dashboard Supports My Role and Halozyme's Mission:**

    - **External Manufacturing Oversight (Per ICH Q10):**
        - This dashboard provides the data necessary for effective management of our CDMO partners, including performance metrics for Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) and a clear view of all ongoing manufacturing campaigns. The **CDMO Oversight Dashboard** provides deeper analytics on site-specific performance.

    - **Technology Transfer (Per ICH Q10, 2.7):**
        - The **Portfolio Gantt Chart** tracks the progress of all technology transfer activities, ensuring a structured and efficient transfer of process knowledge to our CDMO partners. The **Technology Transfer Dashboard** provides a granular, checklist-driven view of each transfer project.

    - **Process Validation (PV) & Continued Process Verification (CPV):**
        - This tool allows for the tracking of PV campaign execution at our CDMOs.
        - For our commercial products like rHuPH20, it serves as the entry point to the **Continued Process Verification (CPV) Dashboard**, which monitors Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) to ensure our processes remain in a state of control.

    - **Quality Risk Management (Per ICH Q9):**
        - The **Risk Matrix** is a direct implementation of ICH Q9 principles. It is our central tool for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks related to manufacturing processes, supply chain, and compliance at our CDMOs.

    - **Deviation & Change Control Management (Per 21 CFR 211):**
        - The KPIs for critical deviations provide an immediate signal of potential quality issues. This dashboard links directly to the **Deviation & Change Control Hub**, where I perform technical assessments of events originating from our CDMOs, ensuring timely investigation and robust corrective actions.

    - **CMC & Regulatory Submission Support:**
        - This Command Center provides a consolidated, data-rich environment that is essential for authoring and reviewing CMC sections of our regulatory submissions (e.g., BLAs, CBE-30s, PAS). It is my primary resource when responding to Health Authority Requests for Information (RFIs) regarding our manufacturing processes.
